In `App.js` we have a simple front-end that allows a user to click a button to add items to a cart. The current number of items in the cart is displayed in real-time.

Instructions:

1. Refactor `App.js` to use React hooks, and optimize the component however you see fit

2. Add a button to remove items from the cart, ensuring the count is accurate when adding or removing items

3. Make time on page update every 30 seconds instead of every second

4. Style the component to match the [provided mockup](mockup.png)
